"""S1: amended 4-family statistical screen (fast staged battery).
Usage: s1_screen.py <candidate> <outdir>

Runs:
  (a) marginal 468-cell screen via screen_cal.screen_calibrated (PB + RD families,
      Fisher-combine + Holm-Bonferroni, alpha=0.01 each) -- existing code;
  (b) LIN + DIFF families on SEQ outputs (10 keys, N=2^18) via lin_diff.py.

Verdict CAL_PASS iff zero Holm rejections across all four families
(PB, RD, LIN, DIFF). Prints verdict line and writes s1_result.json into outdir.
Exit 0 on CAL_PASS, 2 on FLAG (stage kill).

STATISTICAL HONESTY NOTES (2026-10-02, peer review MAJOR-4/5):
- The old docstring claimed "honest FWER <= 0.04". That is overstated: 3 of the
  4 families Fisher-combine dependent p-values, which is liberal (the code
  admits this in its own docstring). Only the LIN family has a rigorous
  familywise guarantee. Treat CAL_PASS as "no gross defect detected", not a
  proven 4% false-positive rate.
- Search multiplicity: with ~17 candidates screened at ~4% nominal each, the
  chance of >=1 false CAL_PASS in a round is ~50%. Leader selection is
  post-selection inference; survivors require independent re-verification
  (audit + peer review), which is what the battery's later stages provide.
